# Statistics-Casino-Game

A random Casino game.

Obviously, the odds are not in your favor, but perhaps you may get lucky.

Choosing the red deck decreases the variance of gains, so you will be less likely to sudddenly lose a lot of money, but you will also never gain a lot of money either.

The blue deck has much greater variance, so if you are looking for a big lucky break, it's a good option.
